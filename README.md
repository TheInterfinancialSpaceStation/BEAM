I have no idea what I'm doing yet

Ok so the objective is an ERC token that is almost identical to HOGE

Except instead of the 2% fee trending to a full burn, the redistribution to burn ratio will go through cycles who's lengths are randomly chosen by the protocol and hidden from the public. 

There will be about 4 cycles per year, 3 stages to each cycle, with each stage lasting a random number of days between 21 and 35 (3 to 5 weeks). No one will be privy to the lengths, Twitter bots will alert everyone of cycle transition blocks.

The cycles go 1st stage -> 2nd stage -> 3rd stage -> 1st stage and then repeat

The 1st stage will have a 2% redistribution rate and a 0% burn rate. 

The 2nd stage will have a 1% redistribution rate and a 1% burn rate

The 3rd stage will have a 0% redistribution rate and a 2% burn rate

The purpose of the cycles is to intentionally create market cycles similar to the cycles experienced by the bitcoin market as an effect of the bitcoin halvenings

The 2nd stage will mark the bottom of the bear market, the 3rd stage will accelerate the rally, the 1st stage pops the bubble and begins distribution. 

Wallet balances are public so everyone can see the leaderboard


If the community chooses to expand the market for the protocol I would be at bliss. Lets make it to coinbase and then nasdaq! However, the initial success of the token will depend on access to liquidity on decentralized exchanges. The true power of the token is unleashed by triangular arbitrage bots on dexes like uniswap, spatial arbitrage bots, and temporal arbitrage bots like robotraders and algotrading bots. The automated volume that muffles decentralized liquidity running through the deflationary token will lock liquidity value into the token over each transaction.

The overall purpose of the protocol is to create a rapid fire financial bubble machine where everyone involved is on equal footing and each bear market floor gets permanently higher due to deflation and locked liquidity, so that just hodling long term will make you break even eventually if you long the top, and swing traders and value investors have transparent advantages.
